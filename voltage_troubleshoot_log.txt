=== POWER SUPPLY RECOMMENDATIONS ===
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 1. Check power adapter specifications:
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - MyCobot 280 requires 12V DC power supply
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Minimum 5A current rating (8A recommended for heavy loads)
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Use only the official power adapter or equivalent quality
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 2. Check connections:
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Ensure power cable is firmly connected
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Check for loose connections at both ends
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Inspect cable for damage or wear
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 3. Environmental factors:
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Ensure adequate ventilation around power supply
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Check ambient temperature (high temp can cause voltage drops)
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Avoid extension cords or power strips when possible
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 4. Load considerations:
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Heavy payloads increase power consumption
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Fast movements draw more current
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Multiple simultaneous servo movements are power-intensive
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO: 5. If problems persist:
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Try a different power outlet
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Test with minimal load (no gripper payload)
[2025-06-04 22:01:04] INFO:    - Consider upgrading to higher-capacity power supply
